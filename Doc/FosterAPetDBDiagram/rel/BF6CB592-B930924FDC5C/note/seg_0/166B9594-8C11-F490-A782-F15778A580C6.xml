<comment>The AttributeDef.EntityTypeId will restrict the attribute definitions that will be available when applying an attribute to an entity. For example, if the attribute definition type is &quot;Pet&quot; then only pets that have a PetTypeId that matches the EntityTypeId will have visibility to the attribute definition.</comment>
